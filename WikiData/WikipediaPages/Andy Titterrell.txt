Andrew James Titterrell (born 10 January 1981 in Dartford, England) is a former rugby union player who played at hooker and previously for England.

Titterrell was educated at the Hugh Christie Technology College in Tonbridge and Sevenoaks School and started playing rugby union at the age of seven at Sevenoaks which also nurtured England prop David Flatman and Sevens specialist Tony Roques.

After learning the game in Kent, he had spells with Saracens and Waterloo before joining Sale Sharks in 2001. His first game for Sale was against French club Auch in 2001. Capped by England at schoolboy and U21 level, he was first capped for England A against Ireland A in 2002. He caught the eye of Clive Woodward with a dynamic display on his first start for England A against Scotland A in March 2002. He gained his second A cap against Italy A in 2003 and was involved in the Churchill Cup success in Canada. He won a place in the England Elite Player Squad for 2003. He was considered an outside chance for Woodward's 2003 Rugby World Cup squad but was ultimately left out.[1]

In 2004, Titterrell earned England A selection against France A in their narrow defeat in Perpignan. He took part in the 2004 senior Summer tour, earning his first senior cap, coming off the bench against the All Blacks in Auckland. He added another when coming on as a replacement against Canada in November 2004.
In 2005 Titterrell was a surprise selection for the British & Irish Lions tour to New Zealand ahead of more experienced players.

In the 2005â€“06 Guinness Premiership, Titterrell played every game for Sale Sharks and was a key catalyst for the team's Final victory in May.[2] Titterrell only missed 1 game during the whole season for the Sharks which was against the Llanelli Scarlets in the Powergen Cup.
