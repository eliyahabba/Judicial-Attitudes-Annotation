He was educated at Tokushima Prefectural Johoku High School and was graduated in economics at Doshisha University. He was nicknamed Destroyer (壊し屋, Kowashiya) and Daimaru (ダイマル, Daimaru).

Hayashi played at Kobelco Steelers.

He had 38 caps for Japan, scoring three tries, 12 points in aggregate. His first game was at 19 October 1980, in a 23–3 loss to France XV, in Toulouse and his last came at 26 September 1992, in a 37–9 win over Hong Kong, in Seoul, for the Asian Championship. Hayashi played at the 1987 Rugby World Cup, being the captain in all the three matches, and at the 1991 Rugby World Cup. He was replaced this time by Seiji Hirao as the captain, but played once again in the three matches, scoring a try in the 32–16 defeat to Ireland, at 9 October 1991, in Dublin. 
In 1990 he studied at Oxford University and also participated in regular matches for Oxford against Cambridge University (Varsity match) and was also elected among the Oxford best 15 (Three of the 19th century players with 120 years of history are included) being the only non-British player elected, a feat achieved by the former All Blacks captain David Kirk, who was missing in the selection.
