Emil Friedrich Kautzsch (4 September 1841 – 7 May 1910) was a German Hebrew scholar and biblical critic, born at Plauen, Saxony.

He was educated at Leipzig, in whose theological faculty he was appointed privatdozent (1869) and professor (1871).  Subsequently he held chairs at Basel (1872–80), where he received an honorary Swiss citizenship and made friends with Friedrich Nietzsche, after which he moved to Tübingen (1880–88) until receiving a professorship at Halle in 1888.

Kautzsch traveled to Ottoman Palestine in 1876, and became one of the founding members of the "German Society for the Exploration of Palestine" (Deutscher Palästina-Verein) the following year.[1]  He was also one of the editors of the Theologische Studien und Kritiken, beginning in 1888.
