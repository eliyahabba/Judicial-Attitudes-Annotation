Nusrat Munir Ul-Ghani[1] (born 1 September 1972) is a British Conservative Party politician who has been Member of Parliament (MP) for Wealden in East Sussex since 2015.[2] She currently serves as Minister of State for Industry and Economic Security in the Department for Business and Trade and the Cabinet Office.[3][4] In January 2018, she became the first female Muslim minister to speak from the House of Commons despatch box.[5]

From 2018 to 2020, Ghani was Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Aviation and Maritime and a Lord Commissioner of HM Treasury under prime ministers Theresa May and Boris Johnson.[6] After having served as vice-chair of the 1922 Committee, she was appointed Minister of State for Science and Investment Security by Liz Truss in September 2022.[7]

Ghani was born in Kashmir[8] on 1 September 1972, the daughter of parents from Azad Kashmir.[9][10] Ghani was raised in Birmingham, England in a working-class background and educated at Bordesley Green Girls' School. She studied at Birmingham City University, graduating with a BA in government and politics, and later gained a master's degree at Leeds University in international relations.[11][12][13][14]

She was employed by the charities Age UK and Breakthrough Breast Cancer, and later for the BBC World Service.[15]

Ghani first stood as a parliamentary candidate for Birmingham Ladywood at the 2010 general election, finishing third.[15]

Following the announcement of sitting MP Charles Hendry's retirement at the next election, Ghani was selected in December 2013 at an open primary in which anyone on the electoral register in Wealden could attend and vote.[16] The primary attracted nearly 400 residents.[17][18][19][20] In the 2015 general election Ghani became the first female MP to hold the seat, being elected with a majority of 22,967.[21] In the 2017 general election Ghani won 61.2% of the votes, increasing her majority to 23,628.[21]

In July 2015, she was appointed as a member of the Home Affairs Select Committee and served until 2017.[22][11]

In 2016, Ghani worked with Barnardo's, the UK's oldest children's charity, to undertake an independent inquiry into harmful child sexual behaviour.[23]

In July 2017, Ghani was promoted to Parliamentary Private Secretary at the Home Office.[24] Ghani was involved in producing reports on home affairs, security, hate crime, policing and immigration.[25]

In 2017, Ghani chaired the Government's Apprenticeship Diversity Champions Network.[26]

She is a supporter of Brexit and described Sir John Sawers, the ex-MI6 chief, as providing only "gloom and doom" about Brexit.[27][14]

In January 2018, Ghani was appointed an Assistant Whip and a Minister within the Department for Transport. Ghani was the first female Muslim minister to speak from the House of Commons despatch box. During the 2020 British cabinet reshuffle, Ghani was dismissed from government and replaced by Kelly Tolhurst in the Department for Transport. She had earlier been discussed as a contender to oversee the High Speed 2 rail line construction.[28]

Although she voted for the second COVID-19 lockdown, Ghani was a steering committee member of the lockdown-sceptic COVID Recovery Group, a group of Conservative MPs who opposed the UK government's December 2020 lockdown.[29]

In September 2020, Ghani "launched an inquiry with the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee exploring how it can look at the UK Uyghur supply chain."[30] The report outlined a series of recommendations to address the use of Uyghur forced labour in UK business supply chains.[31] Ghani was instrumental in the cross-party campaign for the introduction of the Genocide Amendment to the Trade Bill.[32]

On 26 March 2021, as a consequence of Ghani's condemnation of the People's Republic of China's treatment of the Uyghurs, it was announced that Ghani was one of five MPs to be sanctioned by China.[33] The sanctions were condemned by the Prime Minister and led the Foreign Secretary to summon the Chinese ambassador.[34][35] On 22 April 2021, Ghani tabled a Motion before the House of Commons declaring that Parliament recognises that China is  perpetrating genocide and crimes against humanity against the Uyghurs. This motion was passed unanimously.[36]

As of January 2022, she was a vice-chair of the 1922 Committee.[37]

In January 2022, Ghani said she was dismissed as a transport minister in 2020 because she was a Muslim. She said that a government whip had told her that, in the Downing Street meeting that decided her removal, her Muslimness was raised as an issue.[14] The Conservative Chief whip, Mark Spencer, came forward as the person who spoke to Ghani and said the allegations were untrue.[38] The Justice Secretary and Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab said the allegations were serious and called on Ghani to make a formal complaint in order to allow an investigation to take place.[39]

On 21 November 2022, Ghani became industry minister, the fourth holder of the post in 2022 and the ninth in four years, succeeding Jackie Doyle-Price.[40][41]

Ghani married David Wheeldon in 2002 and has one child.[14][11]
