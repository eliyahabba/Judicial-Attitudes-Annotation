Dr Percy Northcote (18 September 1866 – 3 March 1934) was an English medical doctor and amateur cricketer who played in seven first-class cricket matches between 1888 and 1903 for Middlesex and Kent County Cricket Clubs and for MCC.[1][2]

Northcote was born in Islington in London,[3] the son of Gilbert and Elizabeth Northcote (née Edwards). His father was a wholesale warehouseman and Northcote was educated at Cranbrook School in Kent.[4] He studied medicine at St Thomas' Hospital in London and made his first-class debut for Middlesex in 1888 whilst a student. He played twice for the county that season as well as for the Gentlemen of Kent in a non-first-class match. The following season, after an innings of 201 not out for the hospital side, he was selected to play for the Kent county side against MCC at Lord's.[4]

He was a "highly regarded" club cricketer for Beckenham Cricket Club,[4] as well as for sides such as Band of Brothers, West Kent and United Hospitals, but only played two further first-class matches for the county side, one against Yorkshire in 1892 and one as a last minute replacement against Gloucestershire in 1895. In 1894 Northcote played for Chatham Cricket Club against the touring South Africans. His final two first-class matches were for MCC.[2][4][5] His Wisden obituary described him as a "good free right-handed batsman" who "bowled slow left arm".[5]

Northcote qualified as a doctor in 1893 and spent much of his career working in London. He married Edith Reynolds in 1921 and died in March 1934 at Marylebone in London aged 67.[3][4]
