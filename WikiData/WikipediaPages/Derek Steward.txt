Born on Onehunga on 9 October 1928, Steward was the son of Albert de Bolton Peel Steward and Doris Steward (née Pilcher) of Paeroa.[2][3] He was educated at King's College in Auckland.[4]

In 1946, Steward won the under-19 men's 120 yards hurdles title at the New Zealand national athletics championships.[5] He went on to win the senior national 440 yards hurdles title in 1949 and 1955.[5]

At the 1950 British Empire Games in Auckland, Steward was part of the New Zealand foursome—alongside Dave Batten, John Holland and Jack Sutherland—that won the bronze medal in the men's 4 x 440 yards relay.[6][7] He also competed in the men's 440 yards hurdles: he won his heat in a time of 54.4 seconds,[8] but finished fourth in his semifinal and did not progress further.[9]

Steward died on 12 October 2017.[10]
