Press reports emerged that Gosling and Oliver founded the public service company Paya Ltd.[57] Oliver first served as company secretary, relinquishing his role after the negative publicity. Gosling was paid by the BBC via this company as a contractor, remaining a director until her departure in 2023.[58]

In 2016, Gosling became embroiled in a tax dispute with HMRC. She was initially one of around 100 freelance BBC staff, investigated into the taxing of off-payroll working (IR35).[59] The same 'disguised employment' loophole, Gosling previously faced public criticism for exploiting. Gosling, Tim Willcox and David Eades eventually appealed to a High Court tribunal in 2019, owing £920,000 in unpaid tax collectively. They argued the BBC forced them to be freelance contractors, paid via public service companies. This was accepted as fact by the tribunal judges, believing there was an “imbalance of bargaining power”. However, it was also ruled “the assumed relationships were ones of employment”, meaning the trio were ultimately liable for the disputed tax.[60]
