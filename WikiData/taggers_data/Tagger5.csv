Aldin left when he developed rheumatic fever but shortly afterwards he sold his first drawing, which appeared in ""The Building News"" of 12 September 1890. This was followed by a dog show picture purchased by ""The Graphic"" in 1891. He rented a studio in Chelsea and in 1892 he began a long association with ""The Illustrated London News"". Whilst at Chelsea he would often draw in the London Zoological Gardens and an early work on a tiger in the zoo which was drawn from life was found to be a copyright of a photograph by Gambier Bolton.

Katamori, or as he was first known, Keinosuke (), had an eventful childhood. Though the Takasu domain was small, it had a high level of prestige due to its status as a branch family of the Tokugawa clan (through the gosanke house of Owari). Furthermore, in the history of the Takasu-Matsudaira line, there were ""daimyōs"" who had been adopted from senior branches of the Tokugawa clan, such as Mito. Consequently, Katamori was in a very good position to be adopted out to a senior member of the Tokugawa house. This opportunity presented itself in the form of Matsudaira Katataka, the 8th generation lord of the Aizu domain. Yoshitatsu readily approved of the adoption, not only because Katataka was the lord of a more senior house with a distinguished history and lineage, but the fact that Katataka was his birth brother must have also entered into the equation. Consequently, the young Keinosuke was adopted by Katataka, and married Katataka's daughter Toshihime, in 1856. Following his adoption, Keinosuke assumed the name ""Katamori"", which made use of one of the characters from his adoptive father's name. He was presented to the reigning shōgun, Tokugawa Ieyoshi, as well as to Ii Naosuke, four months after his adoption, and at the end of the year was invested with the court title of ""Wakasa no Kami"" (), which was traditionally held by the heir to the house of Aizu.
